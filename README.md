# Fractal Starter Kit üõ†

I made this starter kit for myself, but you are more than welcome to use it for your own projects.

## Getting started

**1.** Install dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```
  
**2.** Start Fractal and the build tools

```bash
$ yarn start
```

**3.** Start building! üî®

## How it‚Äôs built

The core principle is ‚Äúless is more‚Äù. Components are organized according to the [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) principle. Fractal is as much out-of-the-box as possible. [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) for templating, [YAML](http://yaml.org) for data. Check out the official documentation for Fractal at [https://fractal.build](https://fractal.build) for anything else.

### Node/NPM

There‚Äôs no Webpack or Gulp here. I opted for basic NPM scripts in `package.json`. Running `yarn start` should be enough, but you might want to runt specific tasks for some reason. Just check out what‚Äôs in the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

### CSS

CSS is bundled with [globcat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globcat) and then processed with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org). The only thing being transpiled is basic `:root` based custom properties. Nothing else. Linting is done with [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io).

### JavaScript

Again using [globcat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globcat) to bundle any JavaScript files found in the `components` folder. No transpiling. Linting is done with [eslint](https://eslint.org).

### SVG sprite

I‚Äôve added support for building an SVG sprite using [svg-sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite) and [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo). Source files are place in the `svg` folder in the root and `svg-sprite` should build them into a sprite that will be included in the `_preview.hbs` template. Check out the `_sprite` component if you‚Äôre curious. [There‚Äôs a good article on SVG sprites on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/).
