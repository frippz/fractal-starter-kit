## Component statuses

Every component have a status that signals whether itâ€™s ready for use in production or not. Currently, the default status is set to `PROTOTYPE` if nothing else is configured. This is set in the config file for each component using the `status:` property.

| Status label | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
{{#each _config.components.statuses}}
  | {{> renderStatusTag this }} | {{description}} |
{{/each}}
